	Mandelbrot Pattern Decoration
	-----------------------------


	After looking at Fabrice's Mandelbrot derivative example, it occurred
	to me that I have a heap of simple Mandelbrot and Julia related 
    demonstrations that I've never gotten around to posting, so here's one 
    of them. I put it together a long time ago using the standard base code, 
    which you'll find in countless examples on the internet. I'm pretty sure 
    I started with IQ's "Orbit Traps" shader, which is a favorite amongst 
    many on here, then added a few extra lines to produce the effect you 
	see. There's not a lot to this at all, so hopefully, it'll be easy to 
    consume.

    Producing Mandelbrot and Julia patterns is pretty straight forward. At 
    it's core you're simply transforming each point on the screen in a 
    certain way many times over, then representing the transformed point 
    in the form of shades and colors.

    In particular, you treat each point as if it were on a 2D complex plane, 
    then perform an iterative complex operation -- which, ironically, is not 
    complex at all. :) In this particular example, the iterative complex 
    derivative is recorded also, which is used for a bit of shading.

    In regard to the shading process itself, most people tend to set a 
    bailout, then provide a color based on the transformed point distance,
	and leave it at that. However, with barely any extra code, it's 
    possible to makes things look more interesting.    

    The patterns look pretty fancy, but they're nothing more than repeat 
    circles and grid boundaries applied after transforming the coordinates. 
    The shading and highlights were made up on the spot, but none of it was
    complex, nor was it based on reality (no pun intended).
